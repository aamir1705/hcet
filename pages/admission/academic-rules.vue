    <p class="text-justify">

      during the college session. Parents &amp; guardians are requested not to
      encourage their wards to take leave from the College. Any kind of leave is
      admissible only with the prior written permission of the Principal but
      this will not be taken into account for relaxation in the attendance
      requirement.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-3xl py-8 font-light">Removal</h4>

    <p class="text-justify">
      The Governing body of the college, on the recommendation of the Principal,

    <p class="text-justify"> 
      A student will be liable to immediate rustication by the Principal, if in
      his/her opinion, the student behaves in a manner subversive of discipline
      or any other offence.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-3xl py-8 font-light">Vacation</h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      As far as possible there shall be a semester break, during the academic
      session and after each academic session, there would be summer vacation.
      The duration of vacation/breaks would depend upon the total number of days
      of vacation declared by the R.G.P.V. Bhopal and Government of M.P.. The
      decision of the Principal of the College in all matters relating to
      admission shall be final and once the admission is taken, the fee will not
      be refunded.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-3xl py-8 font-light">Important Information</h4>

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      Special attention is drawn to the decision of the Supreme Court for
      student leaving midstream. If an institution feels that any particular
      student may leave in midstream, then it may require that the student give
      a bond/bank guarantee that the balance fees for the whole course would be
      received by the institute even if the student left in midstream. The
      institution would inform the candidate in writing before he finalises the
      admission in the institution and also publish it in the college
      prospectus/brochure. The provision for cancelling of admission before the
      last date of admission notified by the university shall apply as mentioned
      in the PET Rule Book.
    </p>

    <h4 class="text-3xl py-8 font-light">
      RAGGING IS A PUNISHABLE OFFENCE. STUDENTS ARE WARNED TO REFRAIN FROM IT.
